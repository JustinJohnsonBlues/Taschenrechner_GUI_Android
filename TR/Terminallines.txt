To build push and run APK (if one already compiles once):
buildozer android debug deploy run
or:
buildozer -v android debug deploy run logcat
witch will give the log back to terminal

For IOS? (works just on Mac Mashines):
buildozer ios deploy run

Or just create the APK:
buildozer -v android debug
